## What is an Aquifer?

An aquifer is an **underground natural storage of freshwater**.

## Water Extraction

Water can be extracted from aquifers via wells.

### Important Considerations

Caution is needed when pumping water from aquifers:

- Aquifers replenish slowly
- Water extraction is faster than aquifer replenishment
- Pumping too much water out of the aquifer could cause the well to dry up entirely

## Best Practices

Responsible water extraction practices are essential to maintain the long-term viability of aquifer systems.
