The San Andreas fault is caused when the Pacific plate, slides past the North American Plate. It is a strike slip fault. It is responsible for the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. There was also the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. If you go back to the homepage, you can see the 4 most recent earthquakes that happen on the fault. You will notice that it says that earthquakes happen, but you don't think you felt it. This is because the earthquakes are very small, and it is difficult to feel the shock waves.
