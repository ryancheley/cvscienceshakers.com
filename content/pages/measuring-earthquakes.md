## How Earthquakes Are Measured

The vibrations produced by earthquakes are detected, recorded, and measured by instruments called **seismographs**.

## Seismograms

Seismographs create "seismograms" that record ground vibration intensity.

## What Scientists Can Determine

Scientists use seismogram data to determine:

1. Earthquake time
2. Epicenter location
3. Focal depth
4. Fault type
5. Energy released

## The Richter Scale

Earthquakes are measured using the Richter Scale for magnitude.


## Recent Significant Earthquakes (7.0+ Magnitude)

1. M 7.6 - Drake Passage
2. M 7.4 - Philippines
3. M 7.8 - Near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia
4. M 7.4 - Near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia

**Note:** Some of these earthquakes may pose tsunami risk.
